    <p>This is pesto is made from pine nuts, parmeggiano reggiano, gran padano, olive oil, basil and garlic blended up together to create a thick sauce.
         I then saute with some onions, garlic, (maybe some chilli), and some red wine cooked off on a high heat. I add in some vegetables (peppers, brocolli, 
         tomatoes, anything really) and cook these until very tender. Then add spaghetti, pesto and small bit of pasta water and mix the pasta and sauce until water
         is cooked off and sauce is mixed fully.</p>
